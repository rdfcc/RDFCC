The Vintage Tankard is an inter-club time trial contested annually between Forest of Dean Cycling Club, Newport Phoenix, and Ross Cycling Club. The event is scored by combining the times of the fastest six riders from each club, making both individual performance and team depth important.

This year, Forest of Dean CC has the honour of hosting on Sunday 28th September at 10:00am on the <a href="../../ttcourses/Vintage-Tankard-Forest/" target="_blank">Lydbrook Hilly</a> course. 

Sign on will be at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gVBSsSXqakT7PRC16" target="_blank">English Bicknor Village Hall</a> from 09:00am.

We look forward to welcoming riders for another competitive but friendly edition of this long-standing event.
